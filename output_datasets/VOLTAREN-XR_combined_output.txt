if O
that O

However O
, O
after O
21 O
2 O
months O
, O
the O
side O
effects O
started O
. O
When O
I O
got O
the O
vertigo B-ADR
, O
I O
had O
to O
discontinue O
. O

Had O
a O
scary O
experience O
that O
I O
am O
associating O
with O
Voltaren B-Drug
. O
Not O
completely O
convinced O
it O
was O
the O
RX B-Drug
but O
I O
have O
no O
other O
reason O
for O
the O
reaction O
. O
First O
dosage O
I O
was O
hit O
with O
extreme B-ADR
abdominal I-ADR
issues I-ADR
including O
diarrhea B-ADR
. O
Figured O
it O
was O
a O
lack O
of O
adequate O
food O
on O
board O
when O
I O
took O
the O
1st O
dose O
so O
increased O
my O
meal O
before O
I O
took O
the O
2nd O
dose O
. O
Problem O
solved O
! O
Was O
on O
the O
meds O
for O
7 O
days O
when O
I O
experienced O
chest B-ADR
discomfort I-ADR
and O
upper O
abdominal B-ADR
pressure I-ADR
. O
With O
a O
medical O
background O
, O
I O
know O
that O
cardiac O
symptoms O
are O
mistaken O
for O
gastric O
reasons O
so O
I O
went O
to O
the O
ER O
. O
Long O
story O
short O
, O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
severe O
gastric O
distress O
GERD B-Disease
and O
with O
a O
gastric O
cocktail O
and O
a O
high O
octane O
prilosec B-Drug
, O
I O
had O
some O
serious O
relief O
and O
sent O
home O
. O
Not O
convinced O
it O
was O
the O
issue O
, O
I O
went O
a O
day O
without O
the O
RX O
and O
then O
started O
again O
. O
I O
wasn't O
entirely O
100 O
after O
taking O
the O
dose O
and O
now O
, O
I O
am O
fairly O
certain O
it O
was O
the O
Voltaren B-Drug
. O
I O
must O
say O
that O
my O
symptoms O
did O
improve O
within O
3 O
days O
but O
the O
ER O
visit O
was O
. O

Always O
tired B-ADR
, O
and O
possible O
blood B-ADR
clots I-ADR
. O
I O
was O
on O
Voltaren B-Drug
for O
about O
4 O
years O
and O
all O
of O
the O
sudden O
had O
a O
minor O
stroke B-ADR
and O
had O
blood B-ADR
clots I-ADR
that I-ADR
traveled I-ADR
to I-ADR
my I-ADR
eye I-ADR
. O
I O
had O
every O
test O
in O
the O
book O
done O
at O
the O
hospital O
, O
and O
they O
couldnt O
find O
anything O
. O
I O
was O
completley O
healthy O
! O
I O
am O
thinking O
it O
was O
from O
the O
voltaren B-Drug
. O
I O
have O
been O
off O
of O
the O
drug O
for O
8 O
months O
now O
, O
and O
have O
never O
felt O
better O
. O
I O
started O
eating O
healthy O
and O
working O
out O
and O
that O
has O
help O
alot O
. O
I O
can O
now O
sleep O
all O
thru O
the O
night O
. O
I O
wont O
take O
this O
again O
. O
If O
I O
have O
the O
back B-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
, O
I O
will O
pop O
a O
tylonol B-Drug
instead O
. O
