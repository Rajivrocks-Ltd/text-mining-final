Unlike O
previously O
taking O

one O
tablet O

, O
which O
immediately O
took O
away O
my O
pain B-Symptom
symptoms O
, O
this O
drug O
had O
absolutely O
no O
effect O
at O
all O
. O
My O
doctor O
prescribed O
this O
drug O
instead O
of O
Aleve B-Drug
, O
to O
be O
taken O
twice O
daily O
, O
but O
after O
reading O
the O
side O
effects O
, O
I O
am O
concerned O
about O
that O
frequency O
. O
I'll O
not O
bother O
with O
it O
anymore O
and O
will O
occasionally O
take O
Aleve B-Drug
instead O
. O
Fortunately O
my O
pharmacy O
made O
an O
error O
in O
only O
giving O
me O
6 O
tablets O
instead O
of O
60 O
. O
I'm O
glad O
it O
happened O
it O
saved O
me O
an O
unnecessary O
expense O
