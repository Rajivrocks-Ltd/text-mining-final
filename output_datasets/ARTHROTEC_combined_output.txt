my O
mother O
in O

has O
rematoid B-Disease
arthro I-Disease
. O
she O
walked O
into O
the O

hooked O
up O

a O

to O
keep O
her O
alive O

one O

she O

an O

she O

she O

an O
infection B-Disease

her I-Disease

lost O
all O

but O
the O
only O
thing O
i O
know O
is O
that O
it O
was O
not O
arthrotec B-Drug
, O
but O
can O
it O
all O
be O
the O

? O

I O

Honestly O
, O
I O
can't O
figure O
out O
how O
I O
can O
lose O
this O
much O
blood O
and O
still O
function O
. O
I O
have O
horrific B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
to O
begin O
with O
, O
so O
I O
can't O
say O
whether O
arthrotec B-Drug
increased O
that O
. O
I O
have O
endometriosis B-Disease
, O
so O
I'm O
not O
sure O
if O
that O
is O
something O
that O
doesn't O
agree O
with O
arthrotec B-Drug
. O
It O
did O
help O
with O
the O
pain B-Symptom
I O
experience O
with O
the O
pinched O
nerve O

but O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
to O
me O
to O
continue O

Arthrotec B-Drug
works O
wonders O

but O
side O
effects O
worry O
me O
. O
Am O
trying O
to O
wean O
off O
it O
with O
glucoasamine B-Drug
chondroitin B-Drug
and O
MSM B-Drug
, O
which O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
good O
for O
arthritis B-Disease
, O
bone O
enhancement O
elasticity O
etc O
Taking O
all O
at O

time O
now O
, O
pain B-Symptom
is O
too O

! O
Was O
on O

just O
took O

about O
30 O

the O
worst O
abdominal B-ADR

ever O
, O
like O
mentstrual B-ADR

diarreah B-ADR
cramping I-ADR
combined O
. O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
dropping O
into O
a O
crouched O
position O
due O
to O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
lower B-ADR
abdominal I-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
i O
was O
put O
on O
this O
medication O
because O
i O
was O
taking O
such O
high O
doses O
of O
Advil B-Drug
to O
quell O
the O
inflammation B-Symptom
in I-Symptom
my I-Symptom

but O
after O
this O
little O
episode O
, O
and O
after O
reading O
that O
it O
can O
cause O
heavy B-ADR

i O
highly O
doubt O
this O
drug O
is O
the O
best O
fit O
for O
my O
problem O
! O
! O
i O
already O
have O
anemia B-ADR

I've O
ever O
experienced O
. O
It O
was O
more O
like O
bowel/uterine B-ADR
cramping I-ADR

It O
was O
so O
severe O
I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O

I O
had O
spent O
the O

there O

given O
a O

I O
then O
spent O
the O
night O
back O
in O
the O
ER O
for O
the O
severe B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
The O
doctor O
thought O
it O
was O
likely O
the O
codeine O
in O
the O
tylenol B-Drug
#3 I-Drug
but O
after O
reading O
all O
these O

Will O

but O
felt O
like O

I O
cannot O
believe O
the O
immediate O
difference O
this O
medication O
had O
made O
in O
my O
life O
. O
I O
could O
not O
get O
up O

walking B-Symptom
up I-Symptom

Heavy B-ADR

Medical O

dismissed O
the O
symptoms O
as O
not O
being O
related O
to O
taking O
this O
drug O
, O
but O
once O
I O
stopped O
taking O

Subsequent O
uterine O
vaginal O

anything O

be O
the O
cause O

abdominal B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
constant B-ADR
soreness I-ADR
in I-ADR
abdomen I-ADR
, O
headache B-ADR
, O
general B-ADR
stomach I-ADR
upset I-ADR
feeling I-ADR
that O
won't O
go O
away O
before O
or O
after O
eating O
. O
I O
was O
taking O
Celebrex B-Drug
until O
ineffective O
, O
then O
Vioxx B-Drug
, O
then O
Lodine B-Drug
, O
and O
now O
Arthrotec B-Drug
. O
I O
realize O
that O
a O
knee O
replacement O
is O
inevitable O
, O
and O
I O
need O
the O
medication O
, O
but O
the O
stomach B-ADR
pains I-ADR
are O
aggravating O
although O
bearable O
. O

None O
that O
I O
noticed O
. O
I O
did O
take O
my O
blood B-ADR
pressure I-ADR
slightly I-ADR
elevated I-ADR
slightly O
elevated O
from O
the O
norm O
. O
I O
suspect O
the O
drug O
is O
responsible O
, O
but O
as O
I O
am O
only O
taking O
it O
short O
term O
, O
I O
am O
not O
overly O
concerned O
. O
I O
had O
acute B-Disease
shoulder I-Disease
tendonitis I-Disease
and O
was O
in O
absolute O
agony B-Symptom
. O
Within O
24 O
hours O
of O
taking O
this O
medicine O
, O
the O
inflammation B-Symptom
was O
reduced O
dramatically O
and O
I O
have O
continued O
to O
improve O
, O
gaining O
back O
more O
of O
my O
range O
of O
motion O
with O
each O
day O
. O

Vaginal B-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
when I-ADR
it I-ADR
was I-ADR
not I-ADR
time I-ADR
for I-ADR
my I-ADR
period I-ADR
, O
headaches B-ADR
, O
neck B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
bloating B-ADR
and O
weight B-ADR
gain I-ADR
. O
It O
helped O
relieve O
the O
pain B-Symptom
in I-Symptom
my I-Symptom
lower I-Symptom
back I-Symptom
but O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
to O
be O
used O
by O
women O
of O
any O
age O
. O
Not O
quite O
sure O
what O
I O
will O
do O
now O
because O
I O
cannot O
take O
Bextra B-Drug
or O
Neurontin B-Drug
. O
I O
guess O
go O
back O
to O
plain O
old O
advil B-Drug
and O
deal O
with O
it O
unless O
the O
doctor O
has O
another O
medication O
I O
can O
try O
. O

vomitting B-ADR
I O
have O
to O
fight O
to O
not O
throw O
up O
I O
am O
supposed O
to O
take O
this O
twice O
a O
day O
but O
it O
makes O
me O
soooooo O
sick B-ADR
that O
I O
take O
literally O
as O
I O
a O
going O
to O
bed O
, O
so O
that O
I O
am O
asleep O
before O
the O
sickness B-ADR
kicks O
in O
. O
I O
have O
tried O
and O
tried O
to O
take O
the O
day O
dose O
but O
I O
would O
rather O
live O
without O
the O
sickness B-ADR
its O
just O
too O
awful O
. O
very B-Symptom
painful I-Symptom
joints I-Symptom
but O
with O
this O
tablet O
, O
the O
pain B-Symptom
is O
much O
much O
reduced O
. O
If O
I O
miss O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
I O
really O
know O
about O
it O
. O
If O
I O
could O
find O
the O
same O
sort O
of O
thing O
without O
the O
EXTREME B-ADR
nausea I-ADR
I O
would O
switch O
drugs O
in O
teh O
blink O
of O
an O
eye O
. O

Slight O
Gasto B-ADR
discomfort I-ADR
, O
but O
usually O
take O
NEXIUM B-Drug
so O
discomfort O
is O
tolerable O
. O
I O
take O
ARTHROTEC B-Drug
50 I-Drug
every O
day O
, O
sometimes O
BID O
and O
have O
found O
nothing O
that O
works O
better O
. O
Now O
I O
am O
running O
out O
, O
am O
un O
insured O
and O
can't O
afford O
the O
medication O
. O
Will O
probably O
go O
back O
to O
IB B-Drug
800 I-Drug
mg I-Drug
BID O
. O

1st O

Honestly O
can O
not O
recommend O
this O
drug O
, O
I O

still O
experiencing O
side O
effects O
just O
after O
1 O
pill O
and O
im O
supposed O

twice O
day O
75mg O
. O
I O
just O
cant O
keep O
going O
have O
to O
try O
something O
else O
. O

Some O
gas B-ADR
diarrhea B-ADR
but O
overall O
OK O
if O
taken O
with O
food O
. O
Tried O
other O
anti O
inflammatories O
but O
this O
is O
the O
one O
that O
works O
best O
for O
me O
. O
Helps O
me O
walk O
carry O
on O
a O
normal O
lifestyle O
because O
it O
eases O
the O
pain B-Symptom
a O
lot O
. O

Stomach B-ADR
pains I-ADR
, O
chest B-ADR
pains I-ADR
, O
anxiety B-ADR
, O
fatigue B-ADR
, O
headache B-ADR
, O
erratic B-ADR
heart I-ADR
beat I-ADR
, O
raised B-ADR
blood I-ADR
pressure I-ADR
, O
dizziness B-ADR
, O
nausea B-ADR
even O
when O
taken O
with O
food O
, O
blurred B-ADR
vision I-ADR
. O
I O
was O
given O
a O
6 O
day O
trial O
of O
Arthrotec B-Drug
along O
with O
a O
9 O
day O
trial O
of O
Aciphex B-Drug
on O
4 O
25 O
three O
bottles O
of O
three O
pills O
. O
This O
was O
a O
solution O
my O
doctor O
came O
up O
with O
. O
I've O
never O
had O
consistant O
heart B-Finding
burn I-Finding
or O
indigestion B-Finding
, O
no O
signs O
of O
acid B-Finding
reflux I-Finding
, O
so O
I O
was O
confused O
as O
to O
why O
he O
would O
offer O
me O
this O
medication O
. O
The O
first O
day O
I O
took O
both O
pills O
, O
I O
experienced O
some O
dizziness B-ADR
and O
some O
nausea B-ADR
and O
some O
serious O
period B-ADR
like I-ADR
cramps I-ADR
. O
I O
was O
at O
work O
, O
so O
I O
just O
had O
to O
brush O
it O
off O
. O
It O
continued O
each O
time O
I O
took O
it O
. O
After O
about O
two O
days O
two O
doses O
, O
the O
cramps B-ADR
continued O
and O
began O
inhibiting B-ADR
my I-ADR
menstrual I-ADR
cycle I-ADR
which O
I O
was O
due O
to O
start O
. O
So O
, O
I O
googled O
the O
side O
effects O
of O
the O
drug O
, O
came O
across O
this O
site O
, O
and O
realized O
I O
wasn't O
the O
only O
one O
with O
those O
side O
effects O
, O
so O
I O
felt O
a O
little O
better O
about O
it O
. O
On O
the O
evening O
of O
4 O
30 O
, O
I O
suddenly O
got O
some O
serious O
chest B-ADR
pains I-ADR
, O
an O
elevated B-ADR
heart I-ADR
rate I-ADR
I O
was O
laying O
down O
with O
my O
husband O
and O
this O
was O
similar O
to O
an O
I O
just O
finished O
running O
! O
heart O
rate O
, O
hot B-ADR
flashes I-ADR
, O
dizziness B-ADR
, O
sever B-ADR
stomach I-ADR
cramps I-ADR
, O
and O
weakness B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
legs I-ADR
. O
I O
literally O
thought B-ADR
I I-ADR
was I-ADR
dying I-ADR
. O
It O
passed O
within O
45 O
minutes O
and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
go O
to O
work O
the O
next O
day O
. O
At O
work O
5 O
1 O
, O
I O
was O
sitting O
at O
my O
desk O
and O
the O
same O
thing O
happened O
. O
I O
stepped O
out O
to O
get O
some O
air O
but O
it O
didn't O
work O
. O
A O
friend O
at O
work O
had O
to O
call O
an O
ambulance O
. O
I O
was O
filled O
in O
by O
the O
ER O
doc O
that O
the O
mixture O
of O
Aciphex B-Drug
and O
Arthrotec B-Drug
was O
insane O
and O
that O
he O
was O
trying O
to O
keep O
from O
cracking O
up O
at O
my O
primary O
doc's O
decision O
to O
combine O
them O
. O

Very O
very O
severe B-ADR
abdonimal I-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
next O
day O
my O
stool B-ADR
was I-ADR
black I-ADR
which O
could O
indicate O
blood B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
stool I-ADR
, O
going O
to O
doctor O
today O
. O
I O
will O
never O
take O
it O
again O
. O

I O
have O
been O
on O
Arthrotec B-Drug
for O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
and O
have O
been O
very O
pleased O
that O
it O
does O
help O
deal O
with O
my O
back B-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
. O
However O
. O
over O
the O
last O
six O
months O
, O
I O
have O
started O
having O
vaginal B-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
almost O
every O
day O
of O
the O
month O
. O
Lots O
of O
clotting, B-ADR
and I-ADR
horrible I-ADR
periods I-ADR
. O
I O
went O
to O
the O
obgyn O
and O
everything O
came O
out O
normal O
. O
The O
doc O
put O
me O
on O
birth B-Drug
control I-Drug
. O
But O
, O
the O
bleeding B-ADR
has I-ADR
not I-ADR
subsided I-ADR
. O
So O
now O
I O
am O
scheduled O
to O
have O
an O
endometrial O
biopsy O
on O
Wed O
. O
I O
had O
an O
ephiphany O
last O
night O
about O
Arthrotec B-Drug
and O
began O
researching O
the O
side O
effect O
. O
When O
I O
came O
across O
this O
website O
, O
I O
was O
appalled O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
females O
mention O
heavy/extra B-ADR
vaginal I-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
. O
I O
firmly O
believe O
this O
is O
the O
answer O
to O
my O
bleeding B-ADR
problem I-ADR
and O
will O
be O
telling O
the O
doctor O
on O
Monday O
, O
. O
Although O
this O
drug O
has O
helped O
with O
the O
pain B-Symptom
, O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
cost O
and O
hassle O
of O
bleeding B-ADR
constantly I-ADR
. O
, O
On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
I O
am O
now O
having O
to O
have O
a O
procedure O
that O
a O
31 O
year O
old O
should O
not O
have O
to O
endure O
. O
I O
truly O
hope O
that O
there O
are O
no O
long O
term O
effects O
from O
this O
. O
I O
have O
not O
taken O
Arthrotec B-Drug
in O
almost O
a O
week O
, O
yet O
I O
am O
still O
bleeding B-ADR
. O
I O
do O
not O
look O
forward O
to O
the O
extra B-Symptom
pains I-Symptom
I O
will O
llkely O
experience O
in O
a O
couple O
weeks O
, O
but O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
can O
find O
something O
else O
to O
deal O
with O
them O
. O
I O
feel O
that O
I O
have O
become O
dependent O
on O
this O
medicine O
to O
function O
. O

Fatigue B-ADR
, O
Constipation B-ADR
followed O
by O
diahorea B-ADR
. O
Eventually O
started O
passing B-ADR
blood I-ADR
and I-ADR
clots I-ADR
with I-ADR
stoals I-ADR
. O
Painful B-ADR
stomach I-ADR
cramps I-ADR
. O
I O
would O
not O
take O
this O
drug O
again O
, O
side O
affects O
caused O
me O
anxiety B-ADR
until O
I O
read O
reviews O
here O
of O
people O
with O
similar O
side O
affects O
. O

after O
taking O
just O
one O
dose O
, O
had O
hunger B-ADR
feeling I-ADR
and O
stomach B-ADR
cramping I-ADR
, O
in O
the O
eve O
and O
through O
the O
night O
constant O
muscle B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
calf I-ADR
muscles I-ADR
, O
couldn't B-ADR
sleep I-ADR
, O
had O
to O
keep O
jumping O
out O
of O
bed O
because O
of O
the O
cramps B-ADR
. O
I O
just O
went O
for O
test O
and O
haven't O
gotten O
results O
yet O
, O
but O
Dr O
feels O
I O
have O
more O
than O
1 O
form O
of O
arthritis B-Disease
, O
I O
also O
have O
a O
very O
sensitive O
stomach O
, O
this O
is O
cheaper O
and O
more O
approved O
by O
health O
insurance O
, O
so O
that O
is O
why O
this O
prescribed O
. O
Seems O
to O
me O
we O
always O
have O
to O
choose O
lesser O
of O
the O
2 O
evils O
, O
I O
can't O
deal O
with O
Charlie B-Symptom
Horses I-Symptom
, O
so O
I O
am O
stopping O
this O
med O
. O

appetite B-ADR
increase I-ADR
, O
stomach B-ADR
feels I-ADR
empty I-ADR
all I-ADR
the I-ADR
time I-ADR
. O
pain B-Symptom
feels O
better O
, O
but O
the O
appetite B-ADR
increase I-ADR
worries O
me O
. O

more O
frequent B-ADR
menstral I-ADR
periods I-ADR
twice O
a O
month O
. O
Works O
but O
can O
realy O
tell O
how O
good O
it O
works O
when O
I O
had O
to O
go O
off O
of O
it O
. O

I O
have O
taken O
6 O
pills O
in O
the O
past O
75mg O
each O
, O
but O
the O
side O
effect O
I O
had O
from O
my O
last O
pill O
was O
awful O
. O
It O
induced O
severe B-ADR
vaginal I-ADR
cramps I-ADR
without O
bleeding O
about O
2 O
hours O
after O
I O
took O
the O
medication O
. O
I O
ended O
up O
having O
to O
take O
additional O
medication O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
cramps B-ADR
pamprin B-Drug
so O
that O
I O
could O
sleep O
. O
Sat O
on O
the O
bathroom O
for O
30 O
minutes O
. O
If O
I O
knew O
I O
would O
have O
went O
to O
bed O
with O
a O
sore B-Symptom
knee I-Symptom
instead O
it O
hurt O
less O
than O
the O
cramps B-ADR
. O
This O
is O
the O
only O
anti O
inflammatory O
drug O
that O
helps O
for O
my O
knee B-Symptom
inflammation I-Symptom
knee B-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
pain O
inflammation O
and O
its O
reliable O
in O
that O
. O
I O
take O
it O
infrequently O
, O
once O
every O
several O
months O
and O
1 O
pill O
is O
often O
enough O
for O
me O
. O

Upset B-ADR

hip I-Symptom

I O
feel O

and O
I O
get O
those O
waves O
of O
nausea B-ADR
where O
you O
suddenly O
feel B-ADR
all I-ADR
clammy I-ADR
. O
It's O
very O
much O
like O
having O
a O
permanent B-ADR
hangover I-ADR
, O
even O
down O
to O
the O

which O
until O

Happy O

Since O

I O
was O
hoping O
this O

helping O
more O
than O

Some O
stomach B-ADR
sensitivity I-ADR
. O
I O
am O
taking O
it O
only O
1 O
time O
per O
day O
because O
of O
the O
possible O
side O
effects O
. O
Without O
this O
drug O
I O
was O
severly B-Symptom
restricted I-Symptom
and O
could B-Symptom
only I-Symptom
walk I-Symptom
less I-Symptom
than I-Symptom
100 I-Symptom
meters I-Symptom
. O
With O
the O
drug O
I O
can O
walk O
1 O
2 O
km O
and O
function O
. O
I O
am O
thinking O
of O
increasing O
it O
to O
twice O
per O
day O
and O
or O
getting O
surgery O
and O
or O
epidural O
steroid O
injection O
. O

No O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
tried O
the O
advertised O
Arthritis O
medicines O
with O
severe O
side O
effects O
and O
only O
tried O
this O
one O
because O
the O
doctor O
had O
samples O
. O
Instead O
of O
taking O
the O
pill O
2X O
daily O
, O
as O
prescribed O
I O
take O
it O
at O
most O
once O
per O
day O
, O
usually O
about O
3 O
4 O
times O
per O
week O
, O
but O
often O
skipping O
a O
week O
or O
two O
at O
a O
time O
. O
My O
arthritis B-Disease
has O
been O
under O
control O
for O
years O
and O
only O
causes O
me O
trouble O
if O
I O
skip O
taking O
the O
pills O
for O
about O
a O
month O
. O
At O
the O
time O
this O
was O
prescribed O
the O
doctor O
was O
discussing O
the O
strongest O
possible O
medicines O
in O
serious O
threatening O
doses O
. O
This O
drug O
has O
been O
a O
god O
send O
for O
me O
. O

This O
greatly O
improved O
the O
swelling B-Symptom
when O
I O
had O
a O
surgery O
on O
both O
legs O
. O
There O
weren't O
any O
side O
effects O
. O
maybe O
a O
little B-ADR
gas I-ADR
but O
may O
not O
be O
related O
to O
the O
drug O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
that O
has O
swelling B-Symptom
of O
any O
sort O
to O
help O
heal O
an O
injury O
. O
The O
doctor O
did O
say O
to O
only O
take O
it O
5 O
days O
though O
because O
it O
reduces O
mucus O
in O
the O
stomach O
and O
it O
can O
cause O
extreme B-Finding
stomach I-Finding
pain I-Finding
if O
taken O
too O
long O
. O

I O
had O
been O
taking O
two O
tablets O
per O
day O
one O
breakfast O
time O
, O
the O
other O
dinner O
time O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
when O
I O
was O
alerted O
to O
possible O
long O
term O
side O
effects O
then O
consulted O
my O
GP O
who O
advised O
because O
of O
the O
time O
I O
had O
been O
taking O
them O
to O
only O
take O
them O
on O
a O
need O
to O
basis O
. O
I O
immediately O
stopped O
completely O
but O
found O
that O
I O
had O
muscular B-Symptom
pains I-Symptom
all O
over O
my O
body O
, O
I O
have O
now O
reduced O
my O
intake O
to O
one O
per O
day O
breakfast O
time O
find O
that O
this O
has O
proved O
a O
moderately O
succesful O
outcome O
. O

I O
have O
spotting B-ADR
and O
it O
had O
started O
2 O
days O
after O
I O
was O
taking O
them O
I O
had O
stopped O
taking O
them O
for O
3 O
weeks O
now O
and O
still O
have O
spotting B-ADR
problems I-ADR
, O
I O
talked O
to O
doctors O
and O
they O
just O
shrugged O
it O
off O
. O
And O
then O
told O
me O
go O
home O
, O
I O
still O
want O
to O
have O
more O
children O
I O
am O
at O
my O
wits O
end O
! O
! O
! O
. O

Headache B-ADR
, O
dizziness B-ADR
. O
I O
took O
1 O
tablet O
today O
, O
and O
won't O
take O
another O
one O
. O
I O
looked O
up O
the O
side O
effects O
because O
of O
a O
headache B-ADR
and O
am O
scared O
to O
death O
by O
what O
I O
read O
. O

The O
pill O
eliminated O
all O
pain B-Symptom
in I-Symptom
my I-Symptom
hip I-Symptom
in O
my O
hip O
, O
but O
it O
was O
hard B-ADR
on I-ADR
my I-ADR
stomach I-ADR
. O
On O
my O
10th O
day O
of O
medication O
, O
I O
experienced O
vaginal B-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
. O
This O
scared O
me O
because O
it O
was O
two O
weeks O
after O
my O
normal O
period O
. O
There O
is O
something O
really O
fishy O
about O
this O
drug O
. O
I O
do O
not O
advise O
anyone O
to O
take O
it O
as O
there O
are O
many O
adverse O
side O
effects O
. O

After O
taking O
my O
first O
pill O
, O
I O
quickly O
experienced O
extreme O
uterine B-ADR
cramping I-ADR
. O
It B-ADR
felt I-ADR
like I-ADR
I I-ADR
was I-ADR
having I-ADR
a I-ADR
baby I-ADR
and O
broke O
out O
in O
a O
cold B-ADR
sweat, I-ADR
shaking I-ADR
uncontrollably I-ADR
, O
nauseated B-ADR
, O
several B-ADR
bowel I-ADR
movements I-ADR
. O
I B-ADR
felt I-ADR
like I-ADR
I I-ADR
was I-ADR
going I-ADR
to I-ADR
pass I-ADR
out I-ADR
, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
welcommed O
after O
feeling O
what O
I O
felt O
. O
The O
pain B-ADR
subsided O
fortunately O
within O
15 O
minutes O
, O
but O
now O
this O
morning O
I O
have O
vaginal B-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
and I-ADR
I I-ADR
am I-ADR
only I-ADR
11 I-ADR
days I-ADR
into I-ADR
my I-ADR
cycle I-ADR
. O
Do O
not O
recommend O
unless O
you O
are O
prepared O
to O
deal O
with O
gut B-ADR
wrenching I-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
going B-ADR
into I-ADR
shock I-ADR
. O
Not O
worth O
it O
, O
I O
will O
continue O
to O
take O
Ibuprofen B-Drug
instead O
. O

No O
side O
affects O
. O
This O
pill O
works O
like O
magic O
to O
releive O
my O
arthritic B-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
! O
I O
don't O
take O
it O
regularly O
, O
only O
when O
required O
approximately O
once O
per O
month O
. O

Has O
been O
all O
OK O
until O
recently O
when O
I O
started O
to O
get O
" B-ADR
fluey" I-ADR
feelings I-ADR
in I-ADR
upper I-ADR
arms, I-ADR
legs I-ADR
etc O
As O
I O
had O
just O
recently O
had O
flu B-Drug
jab I-Drug
thought O
this O
was O
the O
cause O
. O
However O
the O
symptoms O
persisted O
, O
GP O
said O
just O
flu B-Drug
jab I-Drug
but O
after O
4 O
weeks O
! O
Noticed O
today O
after O
leaving O
Artrotec B-Drug
off O
for O
a O
day O
or O
so O
, O
that O
things O
were O
much O
better O
until O
I O
took O
one O
dose O
. O
fluey B-ADR
feelings I-ADR
returned O
within O
a O
hour O
. O
Draw O
your O
own O
conclusions O
. O

Initially O
, O
I O
experienced O
a O
slight O
, O
but O
noticeable O
difference O
in O
pain O
level O

pain B-Symptom
severe I-Symptom
severe O
. O
Within O
a O
few O
days O
, O
I O
noticed O
acid B-ADR
reflux I-ADR
shortly O
after O
taking O

and O
it O
got O
progressively O
worse O
. O
It O
got O
to O
the O
point O
that O
I O
was O
apprehensive O
about O
going O
to O
bed O
I O
consistently O
found O
myself O
waking O
up O
with O
acidic B-ADR
bile I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
mouth I-ADR
, O
tasting O
like O
I O
had O
thrown O
up O

of O
5 O
days O
. O
Stomach B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
, O
gas B-ADR
, O
constipation B-ADR
, O

, O
maybe O
a O
coincidence O
, O
the O
muscles B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
left I-ADR
leg I-ADR
locked I-ADR
up I-ADR

i O
described O
all O

nothing O

I O
kept O

all O
night O
. O
I O
felt O
a O
deep B-ADR
ache I-ADR
from I-ADR
my I-ADR
waist I-ADR
down I-ADR
to I-ADR
the I-ADR

through O

On O

my O

the O
deep B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
pelvis I-ADR
and I-ADR
down I-ADR
my I-ADR

filled I-ADR
with I-ADR
cold I-ADR
metal I-ADR
and I-ADR
ached I-ADR
deeply I-ADR

I O
was O
just O
tapering O
off O

when O
I O
took O

breasts B-ADR
getting I-ADR
more I-ADR
and I-ADR
more I-ADR
(and I-ADR
more! I-ADR
. O
The O
side O
effects O
were O
harder O
to O
deal O
with O
than O
the O
condition O
I O
was O
taking O
it O
for O
and O
it O
made O
me O
feel O
200 O
worse O
! O
Not O
worth O
it O
! O
I O
will O
carefully O
take O
ibuprofen B-Drug
or O
Aleve B-Drug
naproxen B-Drug
sodium I-Drug
limit O
using O
it O
as O
much O
as O
I O

if O
I O
ever O
end O
up O
with O
one O
! O
Taking O
this O
horrid O
stuff O
to O
prevent O
one O
just O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
! O
Pharmacist O
finds O
it O
hard O
to O
believe O
one O

did O
all O
this O
but O
looked O
at O

It O
may O

I O
was O
prescribed O
this O
drug O
because O
I O
had O
spent O
a O
whole O
night O
in O
complete O
agony B-Symptom
abdominal B-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
, O
lower B-Symptom
back I-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
, O
all O
that O
I O
imagine O
labor B-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
to O
be O
, O
except O
I O
was O
not O
in O
labor O
. O
Though O
the O
cause O
of O
my O
pain B-Symptom
remains O
undetermined O
, O
the O
Arthrotec B-Drug
combined O
with O
Paracetamol B-Drug
pretty O
much O
eliminated O
the O
pain B-Symptom
. O
This O
was O
a O
big O
relief O
, O
as O
the O
1200 O
MG O
of O
Ibuprofen B-Drug
I O
had O
taken O
throughout O
the O
night O
had O
done O
nothing O
. O
I O
only O
took O
1 O
Arthrotec B-Drug
and O
1 O
Paracetamol B-Drug
and O
that O
did O
the O
trick O
. O
HOWEVER O
I O
had O
a O
very O
bad O
headache B-ADR
yesterday O
and O
Ibuprofen B-Drug
again O
didn't O
work O
. O
I O
still O
had O
the O
other O
Arthrotec B-Drug
pills O
left O
, O
so O
I O
took O
one O
. O
Although O
it O
alleviated O
the O
pain B-Symptom
, O
I O
got O
up O
this O
morning O
with O
heavy B-ADR
vaginal I-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
even O
though O
my O
period O
ended O
last O
week O
. O
I O
was O
relieved O
to O
read O
that O
this O
could O
be O
a O
side O
effect O
, O
as O
it O
means O
I O
probably O
don't O
have O
something O
serious O
, O
but O
I O
will O
have O
to O
be O
in O
some O
serious B-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
to O
risk O
bleeding B-Symptom
from I-Symptom
the I-Symptom
vagina I-Symptom
again O
. O
Next O
time O
I'll O
try O
my O
luck O
with O
Paracetamol B-Drug
. O
The O
pill O
I O
took O
consisted O
of O
50 O
MG O
Diclofenac B-Drug
and I-Drug
Misoprostol I-Drug
Misoprostol O
. O

The O
day O
after O
I O
started O
taking O
it O
, O
I O
had O
a O
little B-ADR
vaginal I-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
in I-ADR
spite I-ADR
of I-ADR
being I-ADR
menopausal I-ADR
for I-ADR
10 I-ADR
years I-ADR
. O
I O
had O
been O
using O
Estrace B-Drug
for O
several O
months O
but O
had O
not O
had O
bleeding O
from O
the O
Estrace B-Drug
alone O
. O
My O
back B-Symptom
does I-Symptom
feel I-Symptom
better I-Symptom
, O
not O
100 O
OK O
, O
but O
probably O
60 O
. O

If O
I O
take O
the O
pill O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
I O
get O
a O
very O
faint O
sensation O
of O
queasiness B-ADR
. O
almost O
to O
faint O
to O
notice O
. O
However O
, O
I O
also O
get O
diarrhoea B-ADR
at O
least O
twice O
a O
day O
. O
There O
are O
no O
gas B-ADR
pains I-ADR
and O
no O
other O
symptoms O
, O
so O
it's O
inconvenient O
more O
than O
anything O
else O
. O
When O
I O
am O
on O
holiday O
at O
the O
coast O
I O
am O
pain B-Symptom
free O
, O
mostly O
, O
so O
don't O
take O
any O
Arthrotec B-Drug
, O
but O
when O
I O
get O
back O
to O
a O
drier O
climate O
the O
pain B-Symptom
is I-Symptom
severe I-Symptom
, O
so O
Arthrotec B-Drug
is O
very O
important O
to O
me O
and O
my O
quality O
of O
life O
. O
It O
also O
allows O
me O
to O
sleep O
. O

Within O
5 O
minutes O
of O
taking O
drug O
, O
developed O
severe B-ADR
uterine I-ADR
cramping I-ADR
severe B-ADR
colon I-ADR
cramping I-ADR
colon O
and O
uterine O
cramping O
. O
Cold B-ADR
sweat I-ADR
, O
fainting B-ADR
, O
heart B-ADR
palpitations I-ADR
. O
Will O
never O
use O
again O
or O
recommend O
. O

Lower O
dose O
for O
first O
month O
produced O
sporadic O
intense O
stomach B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
, O
diarrhea B-ADR
and O
nausea B-ADR
. O
Always O
prided O
myself O
on O
having O
a O
cast O
iron O
stomach O
until O
this O
script O
came O
along O
. O
I O
have O
to O
rate O
it O
a O
5 O
for O
knee B-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
so O
I O
lived O
with O
it O
. O
Then O
my O
doctor O
increased O
the O
dose O
after O
one O
month O
and O
I O
have O
never O
had O
anything O
work O
so O
well O
on O
reducing O
osteoarthritis B-Disease
pain B-Symptom
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
I O
have O
also O
never O
been O
so O
sick B-ADR
from O
a O
prescription O
. O
Increased O
dosage O
produced O
constant O
, O
unyielding O
stomach B-ADR
gas I-ADR
and I-ADR
intense I-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
gastrointestinal B-ADR
cramping I-ADR
, O
diarrhea B-ADR
and O
pain B-ADR
pain I-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
If O
your O
gastrointestinal O
system O
can O
handle O
it O
, O
its O
an O
amazingly O
effective O
arthritis B-Disease
drug O
. O
however O
I O
welcomed O
the O
knee B-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
back O
after O
suffering O
the O
side O
effects O
and O
booked O
an O
appointment O
with O
a O
knee O
surgeon O
! O
. O
Was O
so O
sick B-ADR
after O
2 O
days O
at O
the O
increased O
dose O
, O
I O
decided O
it O
just O
was O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

I've O
been O
post-menopausal B-ADR
and I-ADR
have I-ADR
now I-ADR
had I-ADR
a I-ADR
six I-ADR
day I-ADR
period I-ADR
and O
have O
now O
had O
a O
six O
day O
period O
with O
all O
the O
accompanying O
tender B-ADR
breasts I-ADR
, O
bloating B-ADR
, O
cramping B-ADR
etc O
I O
had O
only O
been O
taking O
on O
an O
as O
needed O
basis O
so O
one O
or O
two O
a O
day O
approx O
. O
every O
3 O
to O
4 O
weeks O
. O

I O
had O
diarrhea B-ADR
for O
a O
whole O
week O
bad O
uterine B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
followed O
by O
heavy B-ADR
menstrual I-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
two O
weeks O
after O
my O
period O
. O
Alot B-ADR
of I-ADR
gas I-ADR
and O
nausea B-ADR
. O
This O
pill O
stopped O
my O
pain B-Symptom
, O
but O
cause O
me O
more O
pain B-ADR
. O
The O
side O
effects O
are O
much O
worst O
than O
the O
pain B-Symptom
itself O
. O

took O
celebrex B-Drug
8 I-Drug
1 O
2 O
years O
. O
when O
it O
stopped O
working O
my O
primary O
physician O
put O
me O
on O
arthrotec B-Drug
75 I-Drug
twice O
a O
day O
. O
less O
convenient O
than O
the O
celebrex B-Drug
as O
twice O
per O
day O
instead O
of O
once O
per O
day O
. O
otherwise O
as O
reported O
by O
other O
comments O
there O
is O
occassional O
joint B-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
from O
increased O
physical O
activity O
. O

Experienced O
excruciating, B-ADR
unusual I-ADR
abdominal I-ADR
pain I-ADR
bowel O
, O
uterine O
and O
lower B-ADR
back I-ADR
pain I-ADR
for O
about O
5 O
hours O
after O
taking O
including O
diarrhea B-ADR
6 O
times O
, O
and O
heart B-ADR
palpitations I-ADR
and O
vaginal B-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
for O
about O
a O
day O
after O
taking O
. O
I O
took O
with O
2 O
aspirin O
which O
I've O
since O
learned O
is O
contraindicated O
and O
some O
fruit O
. O
This O
may O
be O
the O
reason O
for O
problems O
in O
my O
case O
. O
I O
will O
not O
take O
it O
again O
as O
the O
pain B-ADR
was O
extreme O
, O
but O
others O
should O
be O
cautious O
to O
take O
with O
lots O
of O
food O
and O
no O
aspirin O
. O

Nothing O
unusual O
or O
that O
Im O
aware O
of O
. O
I O
have O
some O
acid B-Symptom
reflux I-Symptom
thats O
developed O
over O
the O
last O
few O
years O
, O
which O
may O
not O
be O
related O
since O
it O
runs O
in O
the O
family O
. O
Works O
great O
! O
Hard O
to O
function O
without O
pain B-Symptom
, O
when O
I O
ran O
out O
. O
Im O
probably O
addicted O
to O
it O
. O
Somewhat O
concerned O
about O
the O
long O
term O
effects O
and O
listed O
possible O
side O
effects O
, O
so O
I've O
only O
ever O
taken O
arthrotec B-Drug
50 I-Drug
once O
daily O
rather O
than O
twice O
, O
which O
is O
just O
enough O
to O
manage O
my O
pain B-Symptom
levels O
. O
I O
feel O
it O
has O
a O
cummulative O
effect O
. O
maybe O
. O
I O
dont O
think O
anything O
will O
completely O
remove O
the O
pain B-Symptom
, O
and O
maybe O
shouldnt O
since O
it O
helps O
you O
to O
know O
whats O
going O
on O
. O
Else O
how O
much O
would O
you O
have O
to O
take O
, O
thus O
increasing O
your O
risk O
for O
possible O
adverse O
reactions O
. O

I O
have O
vaginal B-ADR
bleeding I-ADR

etc O
I O
took O
it O
3 O
times O
the O
first O
for O
3 O
days O
, O
then O
I O
stopped O
because O
it O
didn't O
make O
great O
improvements O
and O
I O
had O
diarrhea B-ADR
. O
My O
doctor O
told O
me O
the O

more O
Second O

a O

some O
a O

time O
I O

the O
ideo O
to O

and O
I O
discovered O
I O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
side O
effects O

taking O
Arthrotec B-Drug
Why O

don't O

Women O
, O
beware O
do O
NOT O
take O
this O
medicine O
unless O
you've O
taken O
it O
in O
the O
past O
and O
it O
was O
right O
for O
you O
. O
Also O
, O
do O
NOT O
take O
this O
if O
you O
might O
be O
pregnant O
! O
I O
checked O
the O
reviews O
on O
this O
website O
before O
taking O
this O
drug O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
oh O
, O
I'm O
sure O
it O
won't O
happen O
to O
me O
. O
Sure O
enough O
, O
2 O
hours O
after O
taking O
a O
single O
pill O
, O
the O
bleeding B-ADR
and O
cramps B-ADR
started O
. O
Never O
again O
will O
I O
touch O
this O
drug O
. O

Particularly O
diahrea B-ADR
! O
Many O
unscheduled O
washroom O

over O
the O

I've O
taken O
this O
medication O

Lately O
ankle B-ADR
swelling I-ADR

lower B-ADR
tendon I-ADR

that O
was O
not O
experienced O
previously O
. O
Males O
tend O
to O
tolerate O
this O
medication O
better O
than O
women O
from O
my O
observation O
. O
This O
medication O
helped O
get O
me O
back O
to O
work O
and O
achieve O
tolerable O
pain B-Symptom
levels O
and O
mobility B-Symptom
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
for O
4 O
days O
and O
the O
pain B-Symptom
returned O
. O
Currently O
take O
one O
75mg O
dose O
2 O
hours O
before O
work O
and O
seems O
to O
be O
enough O
to O
ease O
my O
particular O
condition O
. O
Probably O
alright O
for O
otherwise O
healthy O
individuals O
but O
those O
with O
other O
medical O
problems O
should O
probably O
avoid O
it O
. O
It O
will O
most O
likely O
exacerbate O
there O
ill O
health O
with O
unwelcome O
side O
effects O

I O

None O
of O
the O

others O
seem O
to O
have O
. O
I O
was O
at O
the O
point O
where O
I O
was O
becoming O
highly B-Symptom
immobile I-Symptom
and O
in O
constant B-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
. O
Started O
taking O
arthrotec B-Drug
and O
had O
IMMEDIATE O
relief O
. O
honestly O
never O
thought O
I O
would O
feel O
that O
way O
again O
. O
recently O
pain B-Symptom
has O
started O
to O
increase O
though O
, O
and O
not O
sure O
if O
I've O
overworked O
my O
back O
. O
or O
if O
I'm O
becoming O
intolerant O

Have O
recommended O
to O
two O

who O
have O
had O
similar O
exceptional O
results O
for O
chronic B-Disease

Terrible O
first O
of O
all O
I O
had O
diarrhoea B-ADR
my O

swelling B-ADR
feet I-ADR
feet O

I O
went O
to O
my O
GP O

the O
results O
of O
my O
blood O
test O
showed O
there O
was O
something O
wrong B-ADR
with I-ADR
my I-ADR
liver I-ADR
and O
I O
am O
a O
non O
drinker O
. O
My O
blood B-ADR
pressure I-ADR
had I-ADR
gone I-ADR
sky I-ADR
high I-ADR
so O
my O
that O
is O
why O
the O
swelling B-ADR
. O
I O
was O
told O
to O
stop O
taking O
Arthrotec B-Drug
and O
am O
now O
using O
a O
natural O
product O
that O
seems O
to O
work O
it O
is O
called O
Pernamax B-Drug
. O

Abdominal B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
Dizzieness B-ADR
and O
blood B-ADR
clots I-ADR
in I-ADR
urine I-ADR
which O
caused O
problems O
with O
urine B-ADR
leaking I-ADR
. O
I O
stopped O
the O
Arthrotec B-Drug
twice O
and O
restarted O
but O
the O
same O
symptoms O
came O
back O
. O
I O
will O
not O
take O
this O

again O
. O

Some O

feels O
a O

like O
my O

is I-ADR
up I-ADR

ago O
and O
it O
was O
pretty O
bad O
. O
Since O
then O
my O
back O
has O
really O
gotten O
worse O
. O
I O
still O
exercise O
everyday O
and O
stretch O
, O
but O
it O
really O
is O
not O
helping O
. O
I O
final O
went O
to O
the O
doctor O
and O
i O
am O
getting O
x O
rays O
on O
my O
spine O
tomorrow O
. O
He O
gave O
me O
about O
25 O
samples O
of O
Arthrotec B-Drug
75 I-Drug
. O
3 O
days O
later O
I O
cannot O
believe O
how O
good O
my O
back O
feels O
. O
It O
has O
to O
be O
this O
drub O
, O
because O
this O
is O
the O
first O
day O
i O
can O
comfortably O
bend O
down O
with O
no O
pain B-Symptom
and O
even O
touch O
my O
toes O
without O
bending O
my O
knees O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
this O
drug O
, O
like O
many O
drugs O
, O
works O
for O
some O
and O
not O
for O
all O
. O
as O
for O
me O
seems O
to O
be O
really O
good O
. O

Within O
half O
hour O
of O
taking O
this O
drug O
I O
suffered O
from O
excessive B-ADR
cramping I-ADR
. O
lasted O
1 O
2 O
hour O
and O
continued O
sporatically O
over O
course O
of O
several O
hours O
. O
Became O
tired B-ADR
, O

, O
shortness B-ADR
of I-ADR
breath I-ADR
from O
pain B-ADR
, O
dizzy B-ADR
, O
nausea B-ADR
, O
unconsolable B-ADR
. O
went O
hospital O
, O
but O
sat O
5 O
hours O
never O
seen O
by O
doctor O
. O
drug O
wore O
off O
on O
its O
own O
and O
went O
home O
to O
rest O
. O
Threw O
away O
the O
remaining O
pills O
. O
Should O
be O
removed O
from O
market O
. O

For O
the O
first O
8 O
days O
of O
ever O
taking O
it O
, O
the O
only O
side O
effect O
was O
a O
similar O
feeling O
you O
get O
when O
you O
have O
an O
empty O
stomach O
and O
light B-ADR
nausea I-ADR
that O
lasted O
for O
no O
more O
that O
30 O
minutes O
After O
8 O
days O
, O
the O
feeling O
elevated O
to O
an O
annoying O
sharp B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
stomach I-ADR
. O
Then O
two O
days O
later O
, O
I O

I O

I O
still O

More O
problems O
and O
this O
time O
I O
had O
the O
ideo O
to O
go O
on O
Internet O
and O
I O
discovered O
I O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
by O
taking O
Arthrotec B-Drug
Why O
they O
don't O
tell O
you O
about O
them O
? O
. O

It O
began O
with O
stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
then O
slight B-ADR
nausea I-ADR
, O
then O
reflux B-ADR
each O
time O
I O
took O
a O
pill O
. O
After O
the O
second O

the O
same O
progression O
of O

only O
now O
the O
abdominal B-ADR

and I-ADR
pain I-ADR
abdominal B-ADR
gas I-ADR
gas O
, O
cramps O
and O
pain O
would O
be O
with O
me O
all O
day O
. O
I O
stopped O
pills O
but O
abdominal B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
persist O
. O
The O
only O
good O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
about O
Arthrotec B-Drug
is O
that O
I O
did O
notice O
pain B-Symptom
relief O
but O
I O
won't O
put O
up O
with O
the O
side O
effects O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
since O
I O
spent O
a O
long O
time O
getting O
rid O
of O
a O
reflux B-Finding
problem O
in O
the O
past O
. O
The O
abdominal B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
abdominal B-ADR
discomfort I-ADR
abdominal B-ADR
gas I-ADR
gas O
, O
cramps O
and O
discomfort O
are O
another O
thing O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
see O
get O
worse O
if O
I O
keep O
taking O
Arthrotec B-Drug
. O
I've O
taken O
Tylenol B-Drug
3 O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
like O
this O
. O
Perhaps O
there O
is O
something O
not O
right O
yet O
with O
Arthrotec B-Drug
. O

Within O
15 O
minutes O
started O
to O
have O
stomach B-ADR
cramping I-ADR
, O
almost O
like O
period B-Finding
cramps I-Finding
. O
I O
was O
on O
the O
toilet O
for O
a O
good O
30 O
minutes O
in O
extreme B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
My O
uterus B-ADR
starting I-ADR
to I-ADR
have I-ADR
spasms I-ADR
which O
was O
the O
worst B-ADR
pain I-ADR
I I-ADR
have I-ADR
ever I-ADR
experienced I-ADR
, O
I O
got O
some O
nausea B-ADR
from O
the O
pain B-ADR
, O
I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
bed O
in O
a O
ball O
and O
just O
lie O
there O
until O
the O
pain O
subsided O
which O
felt O
like O
an O
eternity O
. O
Then O
when O
the O
pain B-ADR
subsided O
I O
begin O
to O
have O
some O
bleeding B-ADR
and I-ADR
I I-ADR
was I-ADR
on I-ADR
day I-ADR
12 I-ADR
of I-ADR
my I-ADR
cycle I-ADR
. O
I O
would O
rather O
die O
than O
take O
this O
drug O
again O
. O
Although O
It O
works O
wonders O
for O
my O
back B-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
, O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
to O
go O
through O
the O
uterus B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and I-ADR
cramping I-ADR
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
try O
and O
find O
a O
sister O
drug O
to O
arthrotec B-Drug
. O
Its O
weird O
because O
I O
have O
been O
taking O
this O
drug O
off O
and O
on O
for O
about O
4 O
months O
and O
this O
only O
has O
happened O
to O
me O
3 O
times O
, O
but O
I O
have O
no O
way O
of O
knowing O
when O
it O
will O
randomly O
happen O
and O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
to O
take O
that O
risk O
. O
I O
have O
began O
to O
think O
it O
has O
something O
to O
do O
with O
the O
day O
of O
my O
cycle O
affecting O
how O
bad O
the O
pains O
will O
be O
. O

I O
have O
no O
side O
effects O
that O
I O
am O
aware O
of O
. O
I O
have O
tried O
various O
pain O
meds O
for O
the O
shoulder O
and O
nothing O
worked O
. O
I O
was O
skeptical O
when O
my O
doctor O
asked O
me O
to O
try O
Arthrotec B-Drug
but O
my O
pain B-Symptom
is O
totally O
under O
control O
without O
any O
apparent O
side O
effects O
