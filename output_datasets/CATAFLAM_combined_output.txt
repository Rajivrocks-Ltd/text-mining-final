Can O
take O
it O
on O
an O
empty O

with O
no O

The O
drowsiness B-ADR
is O
nice O

helps O
me O
sleep O

Overall O
an O
excellent O
drug O
that O
works O
better O
than O
any O
other O
NSAID O
I've O
tried O
! O
. O
I O
was O
surprised O
to O
find O
that O
this O
drug O
noticeably O
lowers O
my O
pain B-Symptom
level O
after O
about O
45 O
minutes O
. O
I O
still O
have O
to O
take O
it O
in O
combo O
with O
a O
stronger O
pain B-Symptom
reliever O
, O
but O
it's O
just O
a O
good O
drug O
for O
aches B-Symptom
and O
pains B-Symptom
. O
Better O
than O
things O
like O
Vioxx B-Drug
and O
OTC O
stuff O

I O
would O

recommend O
this O

the O
only O
NSAID O
I've O
ever O
taken O
that O
gave O
me O
discernable O
relief O
within O
90 O
minutes O
of O
taking O
it O
. O
Gastrointestinal B-ADR
problems I-ADR
were O
due O
largely O
to O
my O
taking O
the O
drug O
too O
close O
together O
, O
or O
after O

consumed O
large O

I O
was O
originally O
taking O

because O
the O
lesser O
dose O
seemed O
to O
work O

My O

urged O
me O
to O
take O
Vioxx B-Drug
, O
Celebrx B-Drug
and O
Bextra B-Drug
at O
different O
times O

of O
course O

the O
relief O
I O
experienced O
was O
not O
as O
dramatic O
as O
the O
Cataflam B-Drug
