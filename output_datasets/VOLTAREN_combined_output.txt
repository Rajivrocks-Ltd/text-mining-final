my I-ADR
back I-ADR
from O
it O
and O
had O
to O
get O
therapy O
for O
those O

I O
know O
it O
doesn't O
make O
sense O
with O
the O
tiny O
dose O
I'm O
taking O
, O
they O
say O
no O
systemic O

from O
the O

I've O
gone O
on O
off O
it O
4 O
or O
5 O
times O
now O
and O
the O
effects O
when O
using O
it O
are O
unmistakeable O
. O

I O
had O
no O
side O
effects O
the O
first O
two O
days O
. O
The O
doctor O
prescribed O
for O
me O
to O
take O
2 O
per O
day O
and O
I'm O
very O
glad O
I O
didn't O
. O
I O
took O
one O
per O
day O
and O
this O
is O
the O
third O
day O
. O
My O
face B-ADR
has I-ADR
felt I-ADR
numb I-ADR
most O
of O
the O
day O
and O
I O
feel O
light B-ADR
headed I-ADR
. O
I've O
had O
to O
get O
up O
and O
walk O
this O
feeling O
off O
, O
which O
has O
not O
been O
fun O
on O
the O
knee O
. O
I O
wouldn't O
suggest O
voltaren B-Drug
because O
it O
did O
nothing O
for O
the O
inflammation B-Symptom
in O
the O
knee O
and O
has O
me O
in O
a O
panic O
until O
I O
can O
get O
this O
stuff O
out O
of O
my O
system O
. O

Heartburn B-ADR
and O
stomach B-ADR
upset I-ADR

It O
seems O
to O
be O
working O
pretty O
well O
. O
I O
still O
have O
pain B-Symptom
but O
less O
severe O
. O
I O
have O
been O
somewhat O
concerned O
about O
taking O
this O
drug O
for O
so O
long O
due O
to O
the O
possible O
side O
effects O
, O
but O
my O
Dr O
checks O
me O
out O
blood O
work O
, O
etc O
every O
four O
months O
and O
I O
seem O
to O
be O
doing O
allright O
. O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
get O
started O
on O
stronger O
, O
possibly O
habit O
forming O
drugs O
. O

my O
feet B-ADR
would I-ADR
turn I-ADR
red I-ADR
or I-ADR
purple I-ADR
, O
but O
otherwise O
no O
side O
effects O
. O
It O
didn't O
seem O
to O
help O
my O
feet O
at O
all O
. O
Didn't B-ADR
even I-ADR
decrease I-ADR
the I-ADR
pain I-ADR
a I-ADR
little I-ADR
bit I-ADR
and O
by O
the O
8th O
it O
seemed O
to O
make B-ADR
it I-ADR
worse I-ADR
. O
I'm O
taking O
a O
break O
for O
a O
couple O
days O
and O
then O
might O
try O
it O
again O
. O

Stopped O

the O
next O
day O
! O
I O

Took O
three O

a O
half O
and O
it O
put O

I O
took O

times O
the O
first O
for O
3 O
days O

then O
I O
stopped O
because O
it O
didn't O
make O
great O
improvements O
and O
I O
had O
diarrhea B-ADR
. O
My O
doctor O
told O
me O
the O
symptoms O
had O
to O
go O
away O
after O
taking O
few O
more O
Second O
time O
I O
took O
other O
3 O
pills O
in O
3 O
days O
. O
little O
improvement O
with O
the O
pain B-Symptom
. O
I O
had O
the O
first O
vaginal B-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
, O
a O
lot O
of O
pruritus B-ADR
and O
my O
skin O
was O
all O
red O
but O
I O
didn't O
know O
it O
was O
diclofenac B-Drug
. O
My O
doctor O
prescribed O
me O
a O
topical O
cream O
, O
did O
some O
vaginal O
test O
to O
exclude O
infections O
. O
I O
had O
my O
cycle O
The O
last O
one O
for O
4 O
days O
. O
More O
problems O
and O
this O
time O
I O
had O
the O
idea O
to O
go O
on O
Internet O
and O
I O
discovered O
I O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
by O
taking O
it O
. O

Severe O
stomach B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
and O
diarrhea B-ADR
. O
I O
will O
never O
use O
it O
again O
, O
worst O
drug O
ever O
. O

none O
whatsoever O
. O
I O
started O
taking O
voltaren B-Drug
twice O
a O
day O
and O
then O
switched O
to O
once O
a O
day O
which O
pretty O
much O
takes O
away O
all O
my O
pain B-Symptom
. O
However O
, O
I O
have O
read O
so O
much O
on O
the O
side O
effects O
that O
I O
now O
only O
take O
it O
once O
or O
twice O
a O
week O
. O
I O
am O
68 O
and O
if O
I O
take O
it O
every O
day O
I O
feel O
like O
a O
25 O
yr O
old O
. O
It O
also O
takes O
care O
of O
all O
my O
arthritis B-Disease
pain O
as O
well O
. O
I O
love O
it O
and O
wish O
it O
didn't O
have O
so O
many O
side O
effects O
. O

dry B-ADR
mouth I-ADR
also O
taking O
cymbalta B-Drug
. O
when O
i O
first O
took O
voltaren B-Drug
, O
i O
didn't O
feel O
it O
helped O
me O
at O
all O
. O
however O
when O
i O
stopped O
, O
i O
was O
in O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
pain B-Symptom
the O
following O
day O
. O
when O
i O
restarted O
it O
, O
i O
started O
feeling O
better O
. O
so O
it O
doesn't O
get O
rid O
of O
my O
pain B-Symptom
, O
but O
does O
seem O
to O
make O
it O
more O
bearable O
. O

Extreme O
diarrhea B-ADR
, O
vomiting B-ADR
, O
extreme B-ADR
sweating I-ADR
, O
dizzyness B-ADR
, O
very B-ADR

but O
no O
fever O
, O
bloody O

. O
Very O
bad O
reaction O
by O
my O
body O
. O

I O
was O
on O
Voltaren B-Drug
to O
work O
as O
an O
anti O
inflammatory O
for O
my O
infection B-Symptom
. O
The O
drug O
was O
horrible O
. O
On O
second O
day O
of O
my O
medication O
, O
I O
experience O
an O
excruciating O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
stomach I-ADR
, O
like O
gastric O
but O
much O
worse O
. O
Along O
with O
that O
I O
also O
had O
a O
sharp B-ADR
pain I-ADR
shoulder I-ADR
shoulder O
and O
couldnt O
sit O
straight O
. O
I O
was O
admitted O
to O
hospital O
after O
20 O
min O
of O
the O
pain O
and O
given O
MORPHINE B-Drug
when O
my O
doc O
knew O
that O
I O
was O
on O
Voltaren B-Drug
. O
It O
was O
acute B-Disease
gastritis I-Disease
. O
Worst O
adverse O
reaction O
I O
have O
ever O
experience O
. O
Doc O
told O
me O
to O
opt O
for O
non O
NSAIDs O
such O
as O
aspirin B-Drug
next O
time O
. O

It's O
not O
clear O
that O
there O
were O
any O
. O
I'm O
concerned O
that O
I'm O
imagining O
them O
because O
of O
the O
long O
list O
of O
potential O
side O
effects O
. O
Medicine O
is O
scary O
, O
but O
it's O
sure O
working O
. O
This O
drug O
was O
prescribed O
to O
help O
with O
severe B-Symptom
knee I-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
while O
I O
wait O
for O
additional O
diagnostics O
and O
possibly O
surgery O
after O
1 O
1 O
due O
to O
high O
deductible O
on O
health O
insurance O
. O
Pain O
was O
bad O
enough O
that O
I B-Symptom
had I-Symptom
trouble I-Symptom
standing I-Symptom
up I-Symptom
from I-Symptom
sitting I-Symptom
position I-Symptom
. O
After O
about O
24 O
hours O
, O
the O
pain O
was O
essentially O
gone O
and O
has O
stayed O
gone O
so O
far O
. O

Very O
rough O
on O
my O
stomach B-ADR
rough I-ADR
rough O
on O
my O
stomach O
. O
It O
does O
not O
matter O
if O
I O
take O
it O
with O
food O
or O
not O
. O
Voltaren B-Drug
Gel I-Drug
rub O
is O
great O
though O
! O
. O

It O
helps O
relieve O
chronic B-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
but O
over O
time O
, O
causes O
intestinal B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
bleeding B-ADR
. O
I O
had O
symptoms O
similar O
to O
diverticulitis B-Disease
blood B-ADR
in I-ADR
stool I-ADR
, O
pain B-ADR
. O
I O
would O
be O
cautious O
about O
paying O
attention O
to O
cramping B-ADR
, O
intestinal/stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
which O
can O
lead O
to O
very O
serious O
conditions O
. O

Possibly O
diarrhea B-ADR
and O
stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
but O
most O
likely O
none O
because O
I O
am O
taking O
this O
with O
a O
nasty O
antibiotic B-Drug
for O
a O
sinus B-Disease
infection I-Disease
that O
definitely O
causes O
diarrhea B-ADR
and O
nausea B-ADR
. O
I O
was O
supposed O
to O
take O
it O
2x O
day O
for O
7 O
days O
and O
then O
2x O
day O
as O
needed O
. O
I O
completed O
the O
7 O
days O
and O
then O
did O
not O
take O
it O
on O
the O
8th O
day O
. O
The O
pain B-Symptom
was O
immediately O
worse O
than O
before O
taking O
Voltaren B-Drug
. O
It O
does O
help O
the O
pain B-Symptom
in I-Symptom
my I-Symptom
knee I-Symptom
, O
which O
is O
a O
strained B-Disease
meniscus I-Disease
, O
but O
I'm O
afraid O
that O
the O
drug O
is O
masking O
the O
pain B-Symptom
which O
enables O
me O
to O
overexert O
my O
joints O
and O
cause O
more O
injury O
. O
This O
really O
makes O
me O
nervous O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
speak O
with O
my O
doctor O
about O
this O
possibility O
. O

occasionally O
some O
leg B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
in O
lower O
left O
leg O
only O
if O
taken O
too O
late O
in O
the O
day O
. O
No O
side O
effects O
if O
taken O
before O
noon O
. O
This O
drug O
has O
helped O
tremendously O
with O
aches B-Symptom
and O
discomfort B-Symptom
from O
the O
arthritis B-Symptom
. O
Totally O
cured O
the O
pain B-Symptom
in I-Symptom
my I-Symptom
foot I-Symptom
from O
tendonitis B-Disease
and O
plantar B-Disease
fasciitis I-Disease
. O

Lots O
of O
stomach O
gurgling O
after O
eating O
, O
which O
has O
been O
consistent O
even O
after O
adjusting O
to O
the O
medication O
, O
and O
initial O
doses O
gave O
diarrhea B-ADR
for O
a O
few O
days O
. O
I O
have O
switched O
to O
taking O
it O
with O
a O
snack O
before O
bedtime O
with O
good O
results O
. O
For O
me O
, O
it O
has O
been O
very O
effective O
pain O
relief O
for O
my O
chronic B-Symptom
bone/joint I-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
from O
a O
broken O
elbow O
. O
So O
effective O
that O
I O
was O
able O
to O
substantially O
reduce O
the O
amount O
of O
narcotic O
pain O
reliever O
I O
was O
using O
once O
the O
Voltaren B-Drug
kicked O
in O
after O
about O
2 O
days O
. O

After O
3 O
doses O
of O
this O
med O
over O
24 O
hour O
period O
, O
my O
pain B-Symptom
was O
better O
however O
, O
I O
experienced O
severe O
stomach B-ADR
cramping I-ADR
and O
diarrhea B-ADR
. O
IBS B-Disease
, O
which O
had O
been O
under O
control O
, O
seems O
to O
have O
returned O
with O
a O
vengeance O
! O
. O

8 O
hours O
after O
taken O
voltaren B-Drug
, O
I O
had O
a O
severe O
allergic B-ADR
reaction I-ADR
. O
My O
skin B-ADR
felt I-ADR
like I-ADR
it I-ADR
was I-ADR
moving I-ADR
, O
and O
the O
itch B-ADR
on I-ADR
my I-ADR
head I-ADR
, O
genitals B-ADR
and I-ADR
lips I-ADR
excruciating I-ADR
excruciating O
. O
My O
lips B-ADR
started I-ADR
to I-ADR
swell I-ADR
, O
then O
my O
tongue O
. O
Luckily O
I O
had O
an O
epipen B-Drug
in O
the O
medicine O
cupboard O
, O
and O
that O
saved O
me O
. O
I O
had O
taken O
this O
medication O
many O
times O
before O
for O
gout B-Disease
and O
a O
bit O
of O
arthritis B-Disease
. O
This O
was O
the O
first O
time O
I O
had O
the O
reaction O
. O
I O
am O
now O
severely O
allergic O
to O
NSAIDs O
. O

I O
was O
on O
celebrex B-Drug
till O
the O
SCARE O
of O
death O
took O
me O
off O
. O
Went O
on O
voltaren B-Drug
. O
Had O
wild B-ADR
dreams I-ADR
, O
gurgling B-ADR
stomach I-ADR
, O
tired B-ADR
, O
moody B-ADR
. O
4 O
months O
ago O
my O
heart B-ADR
stopped I-ADR
and O
they O
said O
I O
have O
high B-ADR
blood I-ADR
press I-ADR
. O
I O
never O
had O
it O
before O
. O
I O
find O
out O
on O
the O
net O
that O
voltaren B-Drug
over O
long O
times O
can O
actually O
cause O
hypertension B-ADR
. O
I O
now O
use O
tylenol B-Drug
extra I-Drug
for O
arthritis B-Disease
. O
Voltaren B-Drug
should O
in O
my O
opinion O
be O
given O
rectally O
to O
the O
mfg O
. O
It O
did O
alleviate O
the O
arthritis B-Symptom
pain I-Symptom
. O
It O
also O
made O
me O
dependent O
on O
tagamet B-Drug
after O
a O
few O
years O
. O
ThenI O
find O
out O
they O
two O
are O
not O
to O
be O
taken O
together O
. O
I O
was O
on O
voltaren B-Drug
for O
over O
3 O
years O
. O

Mild O
sedation B-ADR
. O
This O
is O
a O
GREAT O
drug O
for O
me O
. O
I O
am O
usually O
VERY O
affected O
negatively O
with O
most O
meds O
. O
Voltaren B-Drug
totally O
relieves O
my O
pain B-Symptom
when O
nothing O
else O
worked O
. O
I O
take O
it O
with O
a O
meal O
so O
I O
don't O
have O
any O
stomach B-Finding
problems I-Finding
with O
it O

It O

This O
drug O
MAY O
have O
caused O
edema B-ADR
of I-ADR
fingers I-ADR
and I-ADR
face I-ADR
after O
taking O
for O
4 O
days O
. O
Also O
may O
have O
caused O
shortness B-ADR

breath I-ADR
. O
Also O
some O
crabbiness B-ADR
and O
cramping B-ADR
as O
in O

. O
Timing B-ADR
off I-ADR
for I-ADR
a I-ADR
true I-ADR
period I-ADR
, O
so O
suspect O
Voltaren B-Drug
is O
the O
culprit O
. O
Took O
one O
50 O
mg O
pill O
each O
day O
for O
5 O
days O
. O
The O
first O
day O
it O
seemed O

go O
away O

It O

The O

diminished O
each O
day O
I O
have O

almost O
all O
the O
time O

now O
my O

I O
am O
short B-ADR

Interesting O

I O
will O
NEVER O
take O
another O
one O
of O
these O

Horrific O
medication O
Suffered O
an O
acute B-ADR
pancreatic I-ADR
attack I-ADR
with O
critical B-ADR
blood I-ADR
levels I-ADR
that O
almost O
caused O
my O
death O
. O
My O
entire O
body B-ADR
was I-ADR
"shutting" I-ADR
down I-ADR
. O
My O
blood O

were O
at O
critical O

, O
BP B-ADR
was I-ADR
very I-ADR

98 O
60 O

Then O
the O
doctor O
in O
charge O
left O
us O
floundering O
on O
our O
own O
, O
going O
from O
one O
specialist O
after O
another O
to O
counter O
what O
was O
happening O
. O
My O
children O
did O
some O
research O
on O
the O
web O
about O
my O
drugs O
that O
I O
was O
taking O
, O
which O
included O
Voltaren B-Drug
, O
and O
learned O
about O
the O
adverse O
reactions O
to O
this O
drug O
and O
I O
stopped O
Voltaren B-Drug
. O
The O
specialists O
agreed O
with O
this O
conclusion O
, O
since O
they O
were O
exact O
to O
my O
problems O
. O
My O
body O
reacted O
and O
I O
recovered O
gradually O
. O
My O
advice O
to O
all O
STOP O
Find O
something O
else O
. O
I O
lost O
2 O
months O
of O
my O
life O
and O
I O
still O
don't O
remember B-ADR
the I-ADR
entire I-ADR
e I-ADR
. O
If O
you O
are O
taking O
this O
drug O
Make O
absolutely O
sure O
that O
you O
get O
blood O
work O
done O
every O
6 O
months O
, O
in O
order O
to O
catch O
any O
critical O

in O
your O

. O
Then O
STOP O
the O
drug O
. O

. O
i O

an O
idiot O
. O
he O
told O

that O

symptoms O
I O
hate O
when O
Pharmecitical O
company O

DR's O
advertise O
and O
experiment O
on O
us O
like O
animals O

I O

At O
first O
it O
was O

no O
pain O
. O
I O
felt O
fabulous O
, O
except O
I O
did O
notice O
mild B-ADR
headache I-ADR
. O
Then O
the O
side O
effects O
kicked O
in O
. O
Now O
, O
if O
I O
take O
only O
one O
pill O
, O
I O

, O
and O
have O
taken O
it O
occasionally O
since O

Basically O
it O
works O
great O
for O
my O
pain B-Symptom
, O
but O
I O
can't O
live O
with O
the O
side O
effects O
. O

Stomach B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
, O
diarrhea B-ADR
, O
fatigue B-ADR
. O

On O
day O
8 O
, O
starting O
wheezing B-ADR
at O
night O
. O
During O
the O
next O
3 O
days O
the O
wheezing O
became O
a O
24 O
7 O
side O
effect O
, O
with O
it O
being O
so O
bad O
at O
night O
, O
I O
couldn't O
sleep O
for O
more O
than O
45 O
minutes O
. O
The O
wheezing O
literally O
woke O
me O
up O
, O
it O
was O
so O
loud O
. O
I O
also O
got O
a O
severe O
skin B-ADR
rash I-ADR
back I-ADR
of I-ADR
my I-ADR
neck I-ADR
back O
of O
my O
neck O
, O
and O
on O
the O
back O
of O
one O
hand O
. O
Doc O
said O
I O
was O
the O
first O
person O
in O
his O
practice O
who O
ever O
had O
an O
allergic O
reaction O
to O
this O
drug O
, O
and O
. O

No O
side O
effects O
at O
all O
in O
first O
24 O
hours O
. O
First O
day O
. O
Immediate O
and O
absolute O
relief O
. O
I O
don't O
get O
immediate O
and O
lasting O
relief O
from O
panadeine B-Drug
or O
Ibuprofen B-Drug
plus I-Drug
. O
Codeine B-Drug
medications O
aren't O
as O
effective O
and O
upset B-ADR
my I-ADR
stomach I-ADR
on O
occasions O
. O
So O
far O
this O
voltaren B-Drug
rapid I-Drug
25 I-Drug
hasn't O
. O
First O
time O
in O
years O
my O
back B-Symptom
ache I-Symptom
has O
gone O
away O
so O
effectively O
. O
Really O
hope O
it O
last O
and O
i O
can O
wake O
up O
still O
feeling O
completely O
pain B-Symptom
free O
. O

I O
have O
a O
slipped B-Disease
vertabrae I-Disease
and O
a O
degenerative B-Disease
disk I-Disease
. O
This O
medicine O
has O
been O
extrememly O
helpful O
. O
I O
don't O
take O
it O
daily O
, O
but O
at O
the O
first O
sign O
of O
a O
flare O
and O
it O
helps O
almost O
immediately O
. O
I O
tried O
Relafen B-Drug
, O
vicodine B-Drug
, O
flexeril B-Drug
and O
OTC O
pain O
relief O
and O
nothing O
has O
helped O
like O
this O
. O

Took O
for O
2 O
weeks O
. O
Towards O
the O
end O
, O
began O
getting O
tightness B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
throat I-ADR
, O
tingling B-ADR
eyes I-ADR
and O
lips O
. O
These O
symptoms O
worsened O
over O
the O
following O
two O
weeks O
, O
especially O
the O
tightness O
in O
my O
throat O
until O
a O
severe O
case O
resulted O
in O
me O
colapsing O
from O
a O
heart B-ADR
attack I-ADR
and O
hospitalised O
for O
a O
week O
. O
Would O
never O
use O
it O
again O
or O
reccommend O
it O
. O

I O
did O
not O
experience O
any O
, O
but O
only O
took O
1 O
tab O
once O
a O
day O
for O
two O
days O
. O
I O
found O
that O
Voltaren B-Drug
took O
away O
all O
my O
pain B-Symptom
, O
i O
rarely O
use O
pain O
relief O
because O
i O
find O
it O
never O
helps O
or O
takes O
too O
long O
to O
take O
affect O
and O
just O
soldier O
on O
. O
As O
i O
am O
only O
young O
and O
relatively O
healthy O
i O
did O
not O
experience O
any O
side O
effects O
. O
HOWEVER O
my O
parents O
both O
have O
had O
bad O
side O
effects O
. O
so O
i O
dont O
recommend O
it O
if O
you O
suffer O
from O
High B-Disease
blood I-Disease
pressure I-Disease
, O
IBS B-Disease
, O
are O
prone O
to O
stomache B-Disease
ulcers I-Disease
, O
prone O
to O
reflux B-Disease
, O
heart B-Symptom
burn I-Symptom
or O
are O
an O
asthmatic B-Disease
. O
Otherwise O
if O
like O
me O
you O
are O
healthy O
and O
just O
need O
pain O
relief O
when O
nothing O
else O
will O
cut O
it O
just O
take O
one O
a O
day O
, O
and O
dont O
stay O
on O
them O
. O
the O
chances O
of O
getting O
side O
effects O
seem O
to O
increase O
according O
to O
the O
length O
of O
time O
you O
continue O
using O
them O
like O
most O
drugs O
and O
the O
effectiveness B-ADR
of I-ADR
the I-ADR
pain I-ADR
relief I-ADR
can I-ADR
also I-ADR
wear I-ADR
off I-ADR
over I-ADR
time I-ADR
. O

It O
only O
took O
three O
pills O
only O
one O
a O
day O
to O
realize O
that O
the O
side O
effects O
can O
be O
quite O
dangerous O
. O
On O
the O
first O
night O
my O
heart B-ADR
was I-ADR
thumping I-ADR
pretty O
hard O
all O
night O
and O
weird O
chest B-ADR
pains I-ADR
. O
On O
second O
night O
same O
thing O
plus O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
kidney I-ADR
area I-ADR
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
stomach I-ADR
stomach O
. O
The O
third O
night O
was O
all O
of O
the O
night O
before O
plus O
nausea B-ADR
and O
skin B-ADR
irritation I-ADR
. O
The O
side O
effects O
quit O
after O
4rth O
night O
. O
Volteren B-Drug
did O
nothing O
to O
help O
my O
arm O
. O
Even O
with O
a O
full O
stomach O
, O
this O
pill O
can O
be O
very O
hard O
to O
handle O
. O
Side O
effects O
can O
easily O
bring O
you O
closer O
to O
the O
grave O
. O

Severe O
stomach B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
and O
diarea B-ADR
. O
Headache B-ADR
and O
drowsiness B-ADR
. O
Only O
took O
two O
pills O
. O
Will O
never O
take O
again O
due O
to O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
. O
Cramps B-ADR
so O
bad O
that O
I O
felt B-ADR
like I-ADR
removing I-ADR
my I-ADR
intestines I-ADR
. O
Very O
scary O
pills O
. O
I'm O
done O
with O
pills O
. O
forever O
. O

Taken O
for O
excruciating O
disc O
related O
shooting O
pains B-Symptom
through I-Symptom
my I-Symptom
hips I-Symptom
and O
down O
both O
legs O
. O
Was O
fine O
for O
the O
first O
2 O
days O
, O
didn't O
feel O
much O
change O
in O
the O
pain O
but O
started O
feeling O
nauseous B-ADR
all O
the O
time O
which O
makes O
it O
hard O
to O
take O
because O
I O
need O
to O
take O
them O
with O
food O
. O
Havent O
had O
any O
for O
2 O
days O
and O
still O
feel O
sick O
all O
the O
time O
, O
I'm O
supposed O
to O
take O
them O
for O
3 O
weeks O
but O
I O
think O
I'll O
just O
go O
back O
to O
the O
dr O
and O
ask O
for O
the O
cortisone B-Drug
injection I-Drug
. O

I O
have O
vaginal B-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
and O
cramping B-ADR
. O
. O
. O
it's O
taken O
me O
almost O
a O
week O
to O
realize O
this O
bleeding O
is O
due O
to O
the O
medication O
. O
The O
bleeding O
started O
almost O
immediately O
after O
taking O
the O
first O
dose O
. O
I O
initially O
thought O
I O
was O
having O
my O
period O
even O
though O
it O
was O
not O
time O
. O
If O
anyone O
can O
give O
me O
info O
regarding O
how O
long O
this O
bleeding O
and O
cramping O
lasts O
, O
I O
would O
appreciate O
it O
. O
