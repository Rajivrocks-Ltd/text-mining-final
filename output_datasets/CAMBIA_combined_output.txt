Tastes O
gross O
heavy O
mint O
flavor O
. O
Felt O
like O
it O
was O
burning B-ADR
my I-ADR
esophagus I-ADR
all O
the O
way O
down O
, O
then O
dry B-ADR
heaves I-ADR
once O
it O
hit O
my O
stomach O
. O
But O
it O
didn't O
make O
me O
actually O
vomit B-Finding
, O
and O
the O
burning B-ADR
sensation I-ADR
went O
away O
quickly O
. O
Was O
prescribed O
Cambia B-Drug
as O
a O
backup O
to O
Maxalt B-Drug
, O
since O
triptans B-Drug
can O
be O
taken O
only O
2 O
days O
week O
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
it O
didn't O
work O
at O
all O
on O
my O
migraines B-Disease
, O
so O
I'll O
continue O
to O
look O
for O
something O
else O
as O
a O
backup O
. O

Because O
of O
aspartame O
component O
I O
experienced O
worse B-ADR
migraines I-ADR
. O
If O
aspartame O
is O
a O
trigger O
for O
your O
migraines B-Disease
, O
do O
NOT O
take O
this O
. O
Most O
doctors O
will O
say O
it O
is O
such O
a O
small O
amount O
that O
it O
will O
not O
matter O
. O
It O
does O
! O
. O

Once O
I O
had O
bad O
nausea B-ADR
due O
to O
taking O
it O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
. O
Also O
causes O
bleeding B-ADR
problems I-ADR
. O
Stops O
migraine B-Disease
immediately O
when O
taken O
early O
on O
when O
all O
others O
didn't O
. O
If O
I O
wait O
I O
have O
to O
take O
two O
doses O
. O
Easy O
to O
take O
a O
powder O
in O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
water O
. O
It O
is O
an O
anti O
inflammatory O
, O
not O
a O
hypnotic O
. O
My O
insurance O
only O
pays O
for O
4 O
doses O
a O
month O
, O
less O
than O
I O
need O
, O
and O
paying O
for O
it O
without O
insurance O
is O
too O
expensive O
. O

Didn't O
work O
. O
